- Small talk if appropriate (weather, traffic) - stay calm
- Re-test presentation if committee wants to see setup
- Final deep breaths

### **Defense Time (20 minutes):**

- Answer directly, then elaborate if needed
- "That's a great question..." (buys time to think)
- If you don't know: "I haven't explored that, but I would investigate..."

### **After Defense:**

- Typically 5-10 minutes
- Called back in for result
- Receive feedback (take notes, don't argue)
- Thank committee
- Celebrate! 🎉

## 🎤 FINAL OPENING & CLOSING STATEMENTS

### **Opening Statement (Memorize Word-for-Word):**

> "Good morning/afternoon. My name is [Your Name], and I'm honored to present my bachelor's thesis titled 'Fair and Robust Training with Adaptive Sample Weighting.'
>
> The central challenge I address is that machine learning systems deployed in high-stakes domains—such as criminal justice, lending, and hiring—often perpetuate societal biases, leading to unfair outcomes for protected demographic groups. My thesis introduces a novel iterative weighting mechanism that achieves perfect fairness on real-world data while quantifying the fundamental trade-offs practitioners must consider.
>
> Over the next 20 minutes, I'll present four key contributions: first, a novel weighting formula combining confidence and correctness; second, the first demonstration of perfect equalized odds using in-processing; third, empirical quantification of the fairness-calibration trade-off; and fourth, practical guidance for when to deploy such methods.
>
> Let's begin with the motivation."

**Duration:** 45 seconds

---

### **Closing Statement (Memorize Word-for-Word):**

> "In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates three main findings:
>
> First, perfect fairness—zero fairness violations—is achievable on real-world data using a simple iterative weighting mechanism. Our method requires just 10 lines of code and achieves equalized odds of zero point zero on the German Credit dataset.
>
> Second, this fairness improvement comes at a quantifiable cost: calibration degrades by 388 to 756 percent across datasets. This is the first empirical measurement of this fundamental trade-off for in-processing methods.
>
> Third, the practical implication is context-dependent: our method is suitable for decision-focused applications like loan approval, where binary outcomes matter, but not for probability-dependent settings like medical risk assessment.
>
> This work contributes to the fair machine learning literature by providing both a novel method and honest characterization of its limitations, empowering practitioners to make informed deployment decisions.
>
> Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer your questions."

**Duration:** 60 seconds

## 🛡️ EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### **If Technology Fails:**
1. **Stay calm** - "Apologies for the technical difficulty"
2. **Use printed slides** - continue presenting from handouts
3. **Draw on whiteboard** - sketch key formulas (w = (c×r)^(1/T))
4. **Explain from memory** - you know this material deeply
5. **Committee will be understanding** - they care about content, not PowerPoint

### **If You Blank on a Slide:**
1. **Pause 3 seconds** - silence is okay, shows you're thinking
2. **Look at slide content** - visual cues trigger memory
3. **Describe what you see** - "This chart shows fairness improvements..."
4. **Glance at notes** - that's why presenter view exists
5. **Bridge to next slide** - "Let me connect this to the next point..."
6. **Don't apologize profusely** - brief "excuse me" then continue

### **If You Run Out of Time:**
1. **At 18 minutes:** Check slide number - should be on slide 16-17
2. **At 19 minutes:** If on slide <18, speed up or skip details
3. **At 19:30:** Jump to conclusions (slide 19)
4. **Better to end on time than rush through** - quality over quantity

### **If You Finish Too Early (<17 minutes):**
1. **Expand on slide 11** (mechanism) - most interesting contribution
2. **Add detail to slide 8** (calibration trade-off) - core finding
3. **Slow down** - deliberate pacing shows confidence
4. **Invite early questions** - "I have time if committee has questions"

### **If Asked a Question You Can't Answer:**
**Good responses:**
- "That's an excellent question. I didn't explore that specifically, but my hypothesis would be..."
- "I don't have data on that, but it's valuable future work. I would approach it by..."
- "That's beyond the scope of my thesis, but if I were to investigate, I'd..."
- "I'm not certain, but based on my findings, I suspect..."

**Never say:**
- "I don't know" (alone - always add hypothesis or redirection)
- "That's a stupid question" (even if it is)
- "You're wrong" (to committee member)
- "I forgot" (say "I'd need to review my notes")

### **Why You Will Succeed:**

1. **You know your material** - 27 days of deep research
2. **Your results are solid** - Perfect fairness is undeniable
3. **You've practiced** - Opening/closing memorized, Q&A prepared
4. **You're honest** - Acknowledge limitations (COMPAS) and trade-offs (calibration)
5. **Committee wants you to pass** - They're evaluating, not sabotaging
6. **Your work is novel** - Validated by comprehensive literature review

**Failure is extremely unlikely** for work of this quality.

- Do in bathroom/private area before entering room

**Self-Talk:**
- "I've prepared thoroughly"
- "I know this material better than anyone"
- "Perfect fairness is a big achievement"
- "I'm ready for questions"
